#Statstical Modelling of Bike station data in Boise Idaho



## Project/Goals
For this project data will be collected from multiple websites in order to gain more insight into possible relationships between bike stations and points of interests near these stations.

## Process
To begin we will explore the websites citybik.es, foursquare, & Yelp.
Once explored we must gather the data using API calls in order to observe this data in our local drive.
Next we will formulate a data frame for each individual data set called from the 3 different sites.
Upon exploring this data we will combine all three data frames in order to explore the relationship between bike station location in Boise Idaho &
High rating restaurants in near by locations.
Last we will create a regression model in order to examine the findings.

## Results
Based on the visualization of the scatterplot the hypothesis was made that there is no relationship between Bike station Location & high rating restaurants.

Upon creating the regression model we were able to confirm that there is no statistical significance between the two variables.

## Challenges 
Quality of data generated from API calls was a challenge faced when gathering data.
As well as time constraints hindered the ability to explore the data in a more thorough manner.

## Future Goals

In the future what could be done differently would be to gather more variable points in order to further test this hypothesis.
As well as try creating data tree in order to better understand any relationships from variables.
